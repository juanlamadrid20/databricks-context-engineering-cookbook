    "### Query Execution Guidance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. These queries are designed to run against the gold layer dimensional model\n",
    "2. Replace 'juan_dev.healthcare_data' with your actual catalog.schema names\n",
    "3. Adjust date filters based on your data availability\n",
    "4. Some queries use statistical minimums (e.g., minimum 10 events) for meaningful results\n",
    "5. Performance can be optimized by adding appropriate indexes and partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Business Metrics Covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Population Health**: Risk distribution, demographics, health outcomes\n",
    "- **Financial Performance**: Claims costs, approval rates, trending\n",
    "- **Care Coordination**: Provider networks, utilization patterns, care gaps\n",
    "- **Quality & Compliance**: HIPAA compliance, data quality, clinical outcomes\n",
    "- **Predictive Analytics**: Risk stratification, intervention recommendations\n",
    "- **Executive Reporting**: KPI dashboards, performance monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dashboard Integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "These queries can be integrated into BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Databricks SQL for real-time healthcare business intelligence dashboards."
