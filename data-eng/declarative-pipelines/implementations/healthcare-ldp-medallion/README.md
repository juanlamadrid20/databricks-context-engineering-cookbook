# Healthcare LDP Medallion Example

## About

This is a sample implementation of a fictitious healthcare use case that demonstrates how to build a production-ready healthcare data platform using **context engineering principles**. The example processes health insurance patient data through a medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) using Databricks Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines, with comprehensive data quality controls, HIPAA compliance, and real-time analytics capabilities.

## Context Engineering Implementation

The project showcases **context engineering** through its PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) framework, where detailed business requirements, technical specifications, and implementation patterns are documented in structured prompts that enable AI agents to ship production-ready code on the first pass. Key context engineering elements include comprehensive documentation in `CLAUDE.md`, detailed PRPs with executable validation loops, and curated codebase intelligence that provides all necessary patterns, gotchas, and best practices for healthcare data engineering on Databricks. This approach ensures that developers have complete context about HIPAA compliance requirements, medallion architecture patterns, and Databricks-specific implementation details before writing any code.
