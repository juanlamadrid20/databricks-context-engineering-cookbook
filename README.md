# What is This Thing?

Imagine you want to build a house. You wouldn't just grab a hammer and start hitting wood, right? You'd hire an architect to draw plans, a structural engineer to figure out the foundation, and skilled builders to follow the blueprints.

**The PRP Framework works exactly the same way for building software.**

Instead of randomly writing code and hoping it works, you use specialized "AI construction workers" who follow detailed blueprints to build your software features correctly the first time.
