# About This Repository
This project focuses on **Context Engineering** methods to build solutions on Databricks.  
It provides practical examples and solution patterns demonstrating how context engineering methods can be applied using the Databricks platform.

These examples are designed to accelerate development, promote best practices, and showcase how context engineering concepts can be operationalized at scale with Databricks.

# About Context Engineering

Context engineering is the discipline of designing dynamic systems that assemble and deliver precisely the right information, tools, and instructions—in the optimal format and at the right moment—so that large language models (LLMs) or generative AI can effectively accomplish complex tasks. Unlike prompt engineering, which focuses narrowly on crafting an input statement, context engineering creates a workflow that integrates relevant data, prior conversations, external knowledge, and tool outputs, ensuring that the AI receives all necessary context to reason accurately, adapt to evolving needs, and deliver reliable results

This approach is especially powerful on Databricks, where unified analytics, machine learning, and application frameworks converge on a single Lakehouse platform.
