# About This Repository
This project focuses on **Context Engineering** methods to build solutions on Databricks.  
It provides practical examples and solution patterns demonstrating how context engineering methods can be applied using the Databricks platform.

These examples are designed to accelerate development, promote best practices, and showcase how context engineering concepts can be operationalized at scale with Databricks.

# About Context Engineering

Context engineering is the discipline of designing dynamic systems that assemble and deliver precisely the right information, tools, and instructions—in the optimal format and at the right moment—so that large language models (LLMs) or generative AI can effectively accomplish complex tasks. Unlike prompt engineering, which focuses narrowly on crafting an input statement, context engineering creates a workflow that integrates relevant data, prior conversations, external knowledge, and tool outputs, ensuring that the AI receives all necessary context to reason accurately, adapt to evolving needs, and deliver reliable results

This approach is especially powerful on Databricks, where unified analytics, machine learning, and application frameworks converge on a single Lakehouse platform.


# About this repo and project structure. 

This repository is organized into a hierarchical structure that reflects the different levels of context engineering solutions:

## Repository Structure

### Technical Domains
The repository is organized around main technical domains such as:
- **data-eng** - Data engineering solutions and patterns
- **databricks apps** - Databricks Application development patterns
- And other domain-specific areas

### Pattern Organization
Under each technical domain, there are several solution patterns. For example:
- **data-eng/declarative-pipelines** - Declarative pipeline patterns for data engineering

### Pattern Structure
Each pattern follows a consistent structure with two main folders:

#### Foundations
The `foundations/` folder contains generic reusable **PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) templates**. These are the building blocks and reference implementations that can be applied across different use cases. They typically contain directions and
todos to fill out for your own implementations.

#### Implementations
The `implementations/` folder contains fully realized sample projects with full PRP files** with complete example code. These are concrete implementations that demonstrate how to apply the foundational patterns to specific scenarios.

This structure allows developers to:
- Start with foundational templates for understanding core concepts
- Reference complete implementations for practical application
- Build upon established patterns for their own solutions
